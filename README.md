# SHIB 
1. Build a cryptocoin from scratch using Python
2. Digitally sign messages and verify signatures
3. Design and build a tamper-proof blockchain to store any kind of data
4. Secure your blockchain with a proof-of-work requirement
5. Open sockets to communicate transactions and block with peers
6. Build a wallet and miner for the cryptocoin.

Using only a few Python libraries, I have build a cryptocurrency from the ground up.
While doing the project I learnt about digital signatures, hashing and proof-of-work mining. I designed and build a scheme for decentralized consensus including communicating over TCP/IP sockets.
